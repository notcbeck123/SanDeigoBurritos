# DSCI 460 S22 Final

Final Project, DSCI 460 (Spring 2022)

  * Fork this repository.
  * Make your professor (jhoggard@edinboro.edu) a collaborator on your copy of the project.  (Go to Settings, then Manage Access on GitLab.)
  * Clone the repository to a directory on your computer.
  * Read the FinalProject file.  
  * Create a separate RMarkdown file in the directory with your final report.
  * Knit the markdown to HTML.  (I recommend doing this periodically as you work.)
  * Make sure you commit (at least) your final work, including your HTML file.
  * Push the final commits back to your GitHub repository. (You will be able to see your commits on the GitHub website.)
  
  The final project is due by 11:59 pm on Wednesday, 2022-05-04.
